The Dambulla Rock allows visitors the ability to the divotors to access the temple. A beautiful scenary can be witnessed from the Dambulla rock and it is very famous among tourists. King walagamba, nissankamalla, and other hindu deities were also represented in these caves. Lord Buddha’s most devoted disciple Ananda is also portrayed in the caves. The largest cave has an area of 52m from east to west and 23m from front to back. </p>
